# SQL-projects
Some SQL projects ive created
1 - The first project is my Final project for the SQL course i took in my degree. I was tasked with creating a database with many different fundemental Concepts from SQL, (every type of relationship, a specific query with a checklist of whats needed, and more)
i created a database that would help track data from a bloodbank.
